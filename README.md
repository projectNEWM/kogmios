## Contributing
[Ktlint]("https://ktlint.github.io/") is used in CI to lint the codebase for every PR.
Before opening a PR, it would be beneficial to run Ktlint locally. 

The project contains a pre-commit hook to run Ktlint for every commit. To enable it, 
install Ktlint and then run the following command:

`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
